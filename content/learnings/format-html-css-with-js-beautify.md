summary: JS-Beautify doesn't just beautify JS

---

This was news to me, but: [JS Beautify][npm] can beautify more than just
JS. It can also wrap + align attributes, if you like:

Possible values:

    auto, force, force-aligned, force-expand-multiline, aligned-multiple, preserve, preserve-aligned

Or on the command-line:

    -A, --wrap-attributes

 [npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify
