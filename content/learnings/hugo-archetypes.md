summary: template your markdown content creation

Hugo [archetypes][a] let you define sets of metadata and even post content for
new posts created on the command line for your Hugo blog.
I have a simple one that adds some additional fields when I create these posts.
The archetype files live in `archetypes/` and match the name of your parent "sections"
directory and the file extension you use for posts, e.g. .md.
