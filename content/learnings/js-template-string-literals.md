summary: interpolate expressions within strings

---

Javascript **template literals** are string literals that support embedded
expressions, like double quoted "foo %{bar} etc" strings in Ruby. You
can use multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them.
They were called "template strings" in prior editions of the ES2015
specification.

syntax: `string text ${expression} string text`

Handily, multi-line strings and newlines are both allowed.

The downside? Syntax highlighting in editors doesn't really work so
well.
