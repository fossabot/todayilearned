Today I Deployed a single-page site with linked (S)CSS + image / font
assets to production successfully with [Parcel][p], a bundler (like webpack),
but a thousand times simpler than webpack.

This is the simple toy page I deployed: [demo][demo].

Parcel bills itself as "a fast, zero configuration web application bundler."

Boom ðŸ’¥
