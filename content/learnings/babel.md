[Babel][b] transpiles your ES6 code back down to older, more compatible
ES5 syntax for browser back-compatibility. Javascript is famously an
interpreted language, and doesn't require compiling to run in your
browser, however, Javascript has suffered (thrived under?) a climate of
confusingly named competing version and specs since its inception.

From Livescript to Jscript to ECMAScript to ES2015 to ES6,

>  Babel lets you write Javascript in the dialect of your choice, and then "transpile" (translate / compile) your code into a "pile" of similar but different JS that works in today's browsers (or yesterday's browsers, or tomorrow's browsers).
