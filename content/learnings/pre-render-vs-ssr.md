Pre-rendering - generating static files for SEO and OpenGraph share previews;  usually requires a *serving proxy* to translate clean URLs to single-page hashbang shit. https://www.toptal.com/front-end/client-side-vs-server-side-pre-rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) is full isomorphism; same code running in client and server. Nuxt is for SSR.
