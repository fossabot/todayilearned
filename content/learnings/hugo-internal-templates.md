description: common utilities, pre-baked for you

---

Today I learned that Hugo ships with a set of pre-configured, [internal
templates][docs] that handle common utilities like Disqus comments,
Google Analytics tracking, OpenGraph meta tags, Twitter, and more.

This is an uncommon dedication and care toward saving the developer time, and I love it!
