Nuxt is a “meta-framework” that extends  Vue.js via npm packages to make pure JavaScript-rendered SPA (no separate HTML DOM), with support for server-side rendering (SSR), Babel, webpack, and all the other things that seem to make React tricky.

It's known as the SSR solution, among other things, i think.
