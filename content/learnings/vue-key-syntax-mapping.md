Due to JS limitations (i.e., keys need to be valid JS identifiers, ie.
unambiguous barewords or quoted strings), so you canâ€™t use "kebab case" on
the left hand side of a bind object expression; it owuld look to the
browser's JS parser like string subtraction (`hummus-peppers`). So, Vue
helpfully and silently accepts camelCase keys instead, and then
evaluates them to dash-case syntax for you (ie: `fontSize` will become
`font-size`). Cool but **magical**.
