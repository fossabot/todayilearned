Donâ€™t mix `v-for` & `v-if` on the same el; v-for has unexpectedly higher precedence.
Instead, move the if to a parent el, and move filters to a computed property (function)
for more performant, dependably logical flow

Keep complicated logic out of HTML templates and in computed functions.
Keep templates declarative!
