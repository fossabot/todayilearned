Part of the "new school" of element tags, `<figure>` marks up explicit
art, as opposed to other imagery that might be part of the UI chrome, or
the site theme, separate from the content.

The <figure> element defines so-called "self-contained" content, like
illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
