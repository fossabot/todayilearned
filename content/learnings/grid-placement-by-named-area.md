summary: AKA using the ASCII-art syntax for CSS Grid

---

CSS Grid also supports a wild and wacky visual [ASCII-art row syntax][docs]!

Click "Result" to see a not-terribly clear example of this odd syntax in
action with a simple grid demo. I used egregiously short two-letter
abbreviated names just so that the ASCII grid arranged nicely. Using
brief names like this isn't strictly necessary, but it seems useful.
