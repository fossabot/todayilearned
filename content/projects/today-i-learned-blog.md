I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static
site generator after considering [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) because Jekyll seems slow, outdated,
and less deeply considered than Hugo. Gatsby might be reasonable if you
need everything to be fairly complicated React app and think seventeen
layers of Javascript is a normal, healthy state of affairs.

I regret nothing.
